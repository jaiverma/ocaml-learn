(* Pokemon types *)

(* Several ways to get a Pokemon's hit points: *)

(* OK *)
let get_hp m =
    match m with
    | {name=n; hp=h; ptype=t} -> h

(* better *)
let get_hp m =
    match m with
    | {name=_; hp=h; ptype=_} -> h

(* better *)
let get_hp m =
    match m with
    | {name; hp; ptype} -> hp

(* better *)
let get_hp m =
    match m with
    | {hp} -> hp

(* best *)
let get_hp m = m.hp


(* Several ways to get the 3rd component of a tuple *)

(* OK *)
let thrd t =
    match t with
    | (x,y,z) -> z

(* good *)
let thrd t =
    let (x,y,z) = t in z

(* better *)
let thrd t =
    let (_, _, z) = t in z

(* best *)
let thrd (_, _, z) = z


(* How to get the components of a pair *)

let fst (x, _) = x
let snd (_, y) = y

(* both fst and snd are functions already provided in the standard library)
